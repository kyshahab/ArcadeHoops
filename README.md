There are 3 parts of the project that need to be set up in orer to run the project.

Part 1: The SQL datbase

First, the MySQLWorkbench application needs to be downloaded. Once it has been
downloaded, open up a connection. Inside of this connection, create a new schema 
called "arcade_hoops". Then copy and paste the text in SQLSrcipt.txt into a query,
which will create the tables needed. 



Part 2: The Java HTTP Servlet

In order to get the servlet running, import the Servlet.zip file into eclipse as
an "Existing Project into workspace." To find the zip file, go into the Code folder, 
then the Back End folder. Make sure that tomcat is installed in eclipse as well.
Then run the code that is based in servlet.java. This should get the server up
and running.


Part 3: The iOS application

Xcode needs to be installed in order to run the application. Once it is installed, 
navigate to the Code folder, then into the Front End folder. Then click on 
"ArcadeHoops.xcodeproj", which will open up the project in XCode. Then inside of 
CloudCommunicator.swift, go to line 31 where the IP address is set. Set the string
to the IP address of the network that your computer is currently on. Save the file,
and connect your iPhone to the computer. Run the application on your iPhone, and
the application should work.
